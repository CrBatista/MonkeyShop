# Set up 
You will need certain steps installed before to start the app.

- We need to check it out if we have:
    * Terminal Git Bash.
    * AWS CLI.
    * Java.
    * Maven.
    * Git.
    * Docker.
> You must know that this tutorial is for Windows. We need Git Bash to run everything that you will install in .zip - 64-bit.

## AWS CLI
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
## Java
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows
> Java 17 
## Maven
https://maven.apache.org/install.html
## Git
https://git-scm.com/download/win
> **IMPORTANT**  We installed git bash too.  
## Docker
https://www.docker.com/


- For every installation, we need to follow the instructions in each site.
When we have everything, we just have to follow the README on local-env.
